## Issues

### Creating an Issue

If you find a bug or problem, or the documentation doesn't make sense, please create an Issue to document the concern.

### Description

Please be descriptive in your Issue. The more information you provide, the more likely someone will be able to help.

### Code Examples

If you're experiencing an issue with the code, the most helpful thing you can do is create an example reproducing the problem. This can be an GitHub repository or [gist](https://gist.github.com/), a private repository you share with the maintainers, or anything to reproduce the issue and show the code causing it.

## Pull Requests

### Creating a Pull Request

If you fix an active Issue, please create a new Pull Request for the problem. There are no guarantees that the code will be merged _"as is"_, but, if you're willing to work with the maintainers, we will surely solve the Issue.

### Description

Please be descriptive in your Pull Request. It's important to be able to understand the context of a change throughout the history of a project.

### Linking Fixed Issues

If the Pull Request is addressing an active Issue, please link that Issue by specifying the `Fixes [Issue #]` syntax within the Pull Request.
