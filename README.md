# csv-to-sql-insert
Provide table data as a CSV ([comma-separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)) file and output a SQL insert statement for a table with the same name as the file.

## Usage ⚙
1. Confirm you have a directory named `csv`
2. Confirm you have a directory named `sql`
3. Save your input CSV file in the `csv` directory
4. In a terminal window, first run `npm install` to install dependencies and then run `npm start YourFileName`. For example, if your file in `csv` directory is `ExampleTable.csv` then run `npm start ExampleTable`
5. Watch the terminal window for any error messages
6. Your SQL insert statement will be saved in `sql/YourFileName.sql`
